This repo contains exercises and projects completed as part of the Big Data Management course I am taking at NYU CUSP in Spring 2019. I'll be updating this repo throughout the spring.

Also check out my repos [nyuProjects](https://github.com/seeess1/nyuProjects "nyuProjects") and [machineLearning](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning "machineLearning") for examples of other work with scikit-learn, pandas, and SQL.
