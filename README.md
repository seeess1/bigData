### Overview

This repo contains exercises and projects I completed for Big Data Management at NYU in the Spring of 2019. We used MapReduce and PySpark to stream massive datasets and find connections in the widely-used Enron email data set and to find spatial patterns in taxi cab rides and Twitter usage.

Also check out my repos [nyuProjects](https://github.com/seeess1/nyuProjects "nyuProjects") and [machineLearning](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning "machineLearning") for examples of other work with scikit-learn, pandas, and SQL.
